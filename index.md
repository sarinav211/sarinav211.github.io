# Sarina Virk's Portfolio

Hello, I am Sarina Virk! I attend California State University Fullerton (CSUF) and I am a Psychology major. I expect to graduate from CSUF in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

  I really enjoyed the first lab because it was the first time I got to write a code. In this lab, we were asked to print “Hello world!” and then edit it so that it says “Hello (our name)!”. Even though it was a simple lab, I was excited to see how the code executed once we pushed it. I also got a better understanding of how to use Github through this lab.

* Lab 6, part 2

  This was one of my favorite labs because I have been wanting to learn how to play Blackjack. It was interesting to learn the rules through writing code rather than learning with actual playing cards. I was also able to practice writing if statements, which I did not understand at first, but then eventually learned through this lab. I enjoyed learning how to write boolean statements in this lab. 

* Lab 7

  This lab was a favorite of mine because I thought that the prompt was interesting. In this lab, we had to write code that validates whether parking on a specific street at a certain time is allowed or not. I also learned how to use logical operators in this lab and where to place parentheses so that the code would run properly.
